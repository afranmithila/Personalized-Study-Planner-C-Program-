This C program helps create an optimal study order for topics based on their difficulty levels using the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithm.

🔹 What the Program Does

Takes a list of study topics and their difficulty levels as input

Classifies difficulty as Easy, Medium, or Hard

Calculates the longest sequence of topics with increasing difficulty

Outputs the best study order, starting from easier topics to harder ones

Displays the length of the optimal study sequence

🔹 Key Concepts Used

Dynamic Programming (Longest Increasing Subsequence)

Arrays and Strings

Backtracking to reconstruct the optimal sequence

🔹 Features

Ensures gradual learning progression

Automatically labels difficulty levels

User-friendly console output

🔹 Example Output
Optimal Study Order (Increasing Difficulty):
Basics (Easy)
Arrays (Medium)
Algorithms (Hard)

Length of optimal study sequence: 3

🔹 Technologies

Language: C

Libraries: stdio.h, string.h

🔹 Use Case

Ideal for students or learners who want to plan their studies from easy to advanced topics efficiently.
